#One-replication document includes 7 R code:
    #L0_desparsified_unbias_Gaussian_normality.R computes AvgLength, CovRate, AbsAvgZ, SDZ for desparsified Nodewise Loreg estimator and            
      TrueLength, AvgLength, CovRate, AbsAvgZ, SDZ for unbias Nodewise Loreg estimator under Gaussian design under one replication and saves the 
      result.
    #L0_desparsified_unbias_Gaussian_normalplot.R computes Z-score of desparsified and unbias Nodewise Loreg estimator under Gaussian design under  
      one replication and saves the result.
    #L0_desparsified_unbias_Gaussian_one-two-stage_lfdr.R computes all 6 estimators of Nodewise Loreg algorithm and returns their support                      
      recovery performance and matrix norm losses under Gaussian design under one replication and saves the result.
    #L0_time.R computes running time of Nodewise Loreg estimator under both Gaussian design and sub-Gaussian design under one replication  
      and saves the result. 
    #L0_Gaussian_NumOfIter.R computes the number of iteration and whether the algorithm converges within the maximum number of iterations of    
      Nodewise Loreg estimator under Gaussian design under one replication and saves the result. 
    #L0_true_length_for_p4000.R computes the true length of confidence interval for elements under one column for desparsified Nodewise Loreg  
      estimator under both Gaussian design and sub-Gaussian design under p=4000 and saves the result.
    #L0_true_length_for_otherp.R computes the true length of confidence interval for all elements for desparsified Nodewise Loreg estimator under both 
      Gaussian design and sub-Gaussian design under p=200, 400, or 1000 and saves the result.

#Combine document includes 6 corresponding R code that combine the results under 400 replications for normal plot, 100 replications for normality,  
   one-two-stage_lfdr, time, and NumOfIter, and 4000 columns for true_length based on the preserved Rdata using code in One-replication document.
